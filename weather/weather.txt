PHP and TinyMUX code originally by Brus using the Yahoo Weather API.

Rewritten by Thenomain using the Weather Underground API.

Re-rewritten by Death@CrescentMoonMux https://github.com/lcanady to
use Python and the Yahoo Weather API (again!) https://www.yahoo.com/?ilc=401,
and the USNO Atrological API http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/api.php.
Weather Underground was great but it's no longer free use for developers! Boo!
